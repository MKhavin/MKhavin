# Hi, my name is Michael. 
Iâ€™m a junior full stack web developer with a passion for building web applications that are both functional and beautiful. I'm proficient in both front-end and back-end development, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.

I have experience in web development. In my projects for front-end I use:
- HTML+CSS;
- JavaScript;
- Bootstrap;
- React. 

For back-end I mostly use:
- NodeJS;
- ExpressJS;
- MongoDB+Mongoose. 

Also I've worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks, including:
- EJS;
- jQuery;
- Microsoft SQL;
- Firebase. 

I'm skilled in creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces, building server-side applications, working with databases, and integrating APIs and third-party services.

As a junior developer, I'm excited to continue learning and growing in my career. I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge. 

In my free time, I improve my skills in Web Development and also try to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development.
